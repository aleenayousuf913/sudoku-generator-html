While I'm working on my newest project, here is my first web app: A sudoku generator

An interactive Sudoku game with multiple difficulty levels, a hint system, and dark mode for comfortable gameplay. Suitable for both beginners and advanced players.

Features

- Three Difficulty Levels
1. Easy
2. Medium
3. Hard
- Hint Button: Get a clue when you are stuck.

- Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes.

- Interactive Gameplay: Fill in numbers directly on the board.
